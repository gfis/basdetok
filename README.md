'''basdetok''' is a Java Package of BASIC detokenizers for variants
of GW-BASIC on different personal computers under DOS and CP/M.
It takes a tokenized (binary)
BASIC file and produces a readable ASCII listing as it would be
stored by "SAVE ...,A".

Currently the following variants are implemented:
 -copy     input = output
 -m20      Olivetti M20 under PCOS
 -msx      MicroSoft eXtended BASIC
 -pc       MS-DOS PCs with GWBASIC.EXE
